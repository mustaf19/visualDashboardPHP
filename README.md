Hello, 
This is a visual dashboard that I did as an assignment for an internship. 

1. This visual dashboard gets data from data base and visualize data in Graphs, Pie charts etc.
2. Files are distributed for different charts and graphs to increase maintainability of the code.

Functionalities:

1. Displays all data from conencted database.
2. Filtering System --> Filter out specific data for various fields to instantly show on charts and graphs and hence, easy to compare between data.
3. Easy filtering and unfilteration.
4. Options in dropdowns are based on all the unique values of that particular Column or field.

## 1.We can click on tags to unfilter.
